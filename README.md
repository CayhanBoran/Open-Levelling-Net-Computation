# Open-Levelling-Net-Computation
  The height of a points in geometric (or differential) levelling is found by calculating the height difference (DH) between the points via rod readings observed on the points. It is simply calculated by subtracting the foresight (or forward) rod reading of later point from the backsight (or backward) rod reading of former one.
  
  A program to calculate an open levelling net. The input values (known heights, backward and forward readings, point IDs)
for the program should be entered by the user manually. The results of the calculations will be printed properly.
